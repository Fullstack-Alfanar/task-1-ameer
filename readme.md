# My project
In this project I prepared a system which allows the user to add different products in a Cart products.

# Description

This repository consists of different files:

1. Html file: contains the structre of the page- html code.
2. Css File: describes the design of the page.
3. Javascript File: contains functions which constitute the engine of the website.

## The Product
In order to add a product to my products Cart you must fill the following:
1. product name
2. product price 
3. product type
4. product image/ the url of the image

## My Cart 
In this Cart you will see all the details of the product you added in the same line of the table. 
at the end point in the line of the table you will see a remove button which if you click on it the line itself will be removed.
